This Privacy Policy describes how Incredible collects, uses, and shares your personal information, as well as your choices and rights with respect to your personal information.

## Scope of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to information that relates to you as an identifiable individual (often referred to as “personal information” or “personal data”) that Incredible receives or collects when you interact with us or our services, website, and software (the “Services”).

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party services, websites, or software, such as third-party applications that may be integrated into our Services via API. Those services, websites, and software are subject to their own terms and privacy policies, and you should read those carefully.

## Information We Collect

We collect and receive the following types of information:

### Information You Provide to Us:

- _Account Information_: To create an account for the Services or to enable certain features, we require that you provide us with information for your account such as name, email, password, and authentication credentials. If you sign up for a paid subscription, we (or our payment processors) may need your billing details such as credit card information, banking information, and billing address.

- _Video and Other Customer Data_: In using our Services, our customers submit or upload video recordings, seek user support, or provide other Customer Data (defined in our Terms of Service) to us. Our use of and processing of Customer Data is governed by our Terms of Service.

- _Other Information You Provide_: We receive other information from you when you choose to interact with us in other ways, such as if you sign up for one of our webinars or e-books, participate in a research study, contest, sweepstake, or event, apply for a job, or otherwise communicate with us.

### Information We Collect Automatically:

- _Usage Data_: We automatically collect usage data about how you interact with our Services when you use them. For example, this could be actions you take on our platform, such as number of videos you’ve recorded or viewed, your sharing activity, or what third-party integrations you enabled.

- _Log Data_: Our servers automatically log certain types of data when you visit or use our Services, for example, when you navigate through our website. This data is stored in our log files and includes, Internet Protocol (IP) address, type of device, operating system or browser, unique device identifiers, browser settings, date and time you visited or used our Services, the referring website, URL parameters, and error and crash reporting data.

- _Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies_: A cookie is a small piece of information that is downloaded to your device by your browser when you visit a website. We use cookies or similar technologies (including third-party cookies) to remember your preferences, understand how you interact with our Services or emails that we send you, maintain the security of our Services, and administer, improve and promote our Services. You can configure your browser to prevent cookies, but please note that disabling cookies may make some features or functionality unavailable to you.

### Information We Receive from Third Parties:

- _Third-Party Integrations_: Third parties may create integrations built on Incredible technology so that their applications can interoperate with Incredible. If you choose to enable an integration, the third-party may share some information about you with us to make your experience more seamless, such as your name, email, or other content or information needed to facilitate the integration. Additionally, if you sign up or login to our Services using one of our single-sign-on providers (e.g., Google, Apple, etc.), we collect authentication information provided to us by the provider to allow you to log in.

- _Marketing Information_: We may receive marketing or demographic information about you from third parties or partners, for example, data about your organization or industry or other public information from sources like social media or online professional profiles. We may combine this information with other data we already have to improve your experience with our Services or inform you of Services we think may be of interest to you.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information in the following ways:

- To provide and maintain our Services.

- To analyze and improve our Services.

- To keep our Services secure and protect against fraud, abuse, and intrusion.

- To provide user support, information, and services requested by you.

- To send important account or security notifications.

- To promote our Services in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If you’d like to unsubscribe from our marketing emails, click the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email. You can also update your notification preferences in your account settings.

- To comply with our legal obligations, including responding to a court order or other valid legal process.

- For other purposes with your consent.

Please keep in mind that customers control their accounts and associated Customer Data. We use Customer Data according to our customers’ instructions and our Terms of Service. Customers are able to: (1) restrict, remove, disclose, and access content and information associated with the accounts in their Workspaces; (2) grant, deny, or limit access to those accounts and Workspaces; and (3) configure the privacy settings for those accounts and Workspaces. If you create a Incredible account with your work email and you aren’t already part of your company’s Workspace, your company may have the ability to add your account (including the content in it) to its Workspace. We’ll give you notice before that happens.

If information is aggregated or de-identified so that it can no longer be reasonably associated with an identifiable person, we may use it for any lawful purpose.

## How We Share Your Information

We share information outside of Incredible only as described below:

- _Trusted Third Parties_: We disclose information to our service providers or other third-parties so they can help us provide our Services and run our business. Examples include for storing Customer Data, payment processing, providing customer service, and helping us with our marketing activities. We’ll only disclose the information necessary for these parties to perform their services for us, and they’ll be bound by contractual obligations to protect your personal information.

- _Other Users_: When you collaborate with others, we display your basic account or profile information for context. For example, if you share a Incredible recording with another user, we’ll let them know that it was you who shared it. Also, when users interact with a video or other content on our Services, we make certain usage information visible to the video owner and viewers, such as who viewed a video (if the viewer is logged in at the time of viewing) or how many times a video was viewed.

- _Administrators_: If you join a Workspace owned by another person or entity, the administrator of that Workspace has the right to access the content in it. Customers and their authorized users may choose to share and disclose information according to their own policies. Also, if you sign up for Incredible with an email domain that is owned or managed by your employer or organization, we may share the fact that you have an account with us and some basic account information with your employer or organization.

- _Change in Business Structure_: If Incredible is involved in a merger, acquisition, public offering, asset sale, insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar change in our business structure, we may need to disclose your information to those involved in the transaction, subject to confidentiality requirements.

- _For Legal Reasons_: We may release your information if we believe it is necessary to comply with the law, regulation, valid legal process, an enforceable government request, to prevent fraud or a security breach, enforce our policies or agreements, or protect our or others’ rights, property, or safety.

- _With Your Consent_: We’ll otherwise share your information only with your consent.For example, if you choose to enable a third-party integration, we may share account information and/or content from your account, but only as authorized by you when you enable or use the integration.

## How We Protect Your Information

We are committed to protecting your information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, and loss. We use industry-standard security practices to keep your information secure, such as encryption, access controls, physical security measures, and internal reviews of data collection, use, and storage. We’ve also obtained various compliance certifications and undergo ongoing audits to ensure continued security and compliance best practices.

However, data transmissions over the internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure or safe from intrusion by others. Be sure to use secure internet connections, protect your login credentials, and create strong passwords for your account.

## Data Retention

We’ll retain information you store on our Services for as long as your account exists or as long as we need it to provide you Services. If you delete your account or your content from Incredible, we’ll permanently delete your account or content within 30 days, unless we need to retain any information to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. For any other information we may receive or collect from you, we’ll retain that information for only as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

## Data Transfers

To provide our Services, we transmit, process, and store data in the United States and other locations around the world. For example, if you access our Services from a foreign country, data may be stored locally on the device you use to access the Services.

We perform data transfers in accordance with applicable data protection law, using the following safeguards:

- _Standard Contractual Clauses_: Where required, we use standard contractual clauses to meet the data transfer requirements for processing personal data that is subject to the data protection laws of the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, and UK and for other international transfers of Customer Data to the extent required by applicable law.

- _Other Valid Transfers_: We will otherwise only transfer personal data to a country that the European Commission or UK authorities have determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal data or pursuant to another legally valid personal data transfer mechanism.

- _Privacy Shield_: While Incredible remains self-certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks and is committed to applying the Privacy Shield Principles to personal data received from the EU or Switzerland, we do not rely on those frameworks as a legal basis for personal data transfers. With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Incredible is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Competent EU and Swiss data protection authorities (or a panel established by those authorities) may address complaints and provide appropriate recourse free of charge with respect to our Privacy Shield compliance, or you can otherwise resolve a complaint by invoking binding arbitration.

## Your Rights

When it comes to your personal information, you have the right to (subject to certain exemptions by law):

- Access your personal information.

- Delete your personal information.

- Correct or update your personal information.

- Transmit your personal information elsewhere.

- Object to or restrict the processing of your personal information.

You can exercise most of these rights through your Incredible account. For example, if you wish to delete your personal information from Incredible, you may permanently delete your account. You can also access and update your account information via your account settings page. If you are unable to exercise your rights through your Incredible account, please contact the administrator of your Workspace, or otherwise you can send a request to privacy@incredible.dev.

## Age Requirement

If you are under 13 years old (or the age of digital consent in your country), you may not sign up for Incredible, and please do not send any personal information about yourself to Incredible. If you believe that someone under 13 or the applicable age of digital consent has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, please contact us at privacy@incredible.dev, and we will take steps to delete the information.

## For EEA, Switzerland, and UK Data Subjects

In general, Incredible is a processor of Customer Data. This means that we process Customer Data only according to our customers’ instructions in accordance with our Terms of Service. For a list of our subprocessors, please visit our Privacy for Humans page. Incredible acts as a controller for other types of personal data where Incredible determines the purposes and means of processing of that data, such as personal data used for marketing or research purposes.

Where Incredible acts as a controller of personal data, our lawful bases for processing include:

- Our legitimate interests (for example, to send you information about new features or upcoming product launches). You have the right to object to our use of your personal data for direct marketing at any time.

- As needed to comply with our contractual obligations (for example, if you sign up for a contest or promotion, we’ll process your personal data as needed for us to perform our obligations under the contest or promotion terms).

- To comply with legal obligations (for example, to respond to a law enforcement request or enforce or defend our legal rights).

- With your consent (for example, if you opt into receiving email marketing from us). You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

You may contact Incredible at privacy@incredible.dev.

If you feel we have not adequately addressed an issue, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority or the Irish Data Protection Commission, which is Incredible’s lead supervisory authority in the European Union. See here for a list of National Data Protection Authorities.

## For California Residents

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) grants additional privacy rights to California consumers, such as the right to:

- Request to know about the categories or specific pieces of their personal information we collect, use, and disclose (including why we collect the information, where we get it from, and who we share it with).

- Request to delete their personal information.

- Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercise of their CCPA privacy rights.

To submit a request, you can email privacy@incredible.dev. We will validate your request by verifying your identity using your account information or other form of valid identification. An authorized agent may also make a request on a consumer’s behalf. Please note that, if you use Incredible as an employee or agent of a business, we may not be required to grant your request to access/know or delete personal information, and we may ask that you contact your account administrator.

CCPA also requires specific disclosures for California consumers:

- We explain the categories of personal information we have collected in the preceding 12 months and sources of that information above under “Information We Collect.”
